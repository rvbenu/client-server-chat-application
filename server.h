 * Thus, a client will never be authenticated by the start of this function. 
 * Thus, the first Packet the server expects is one with username and password 
 * fields not empty so that the client can be authenticated.

 * Functions `userRegister` and `userLogin` are implemented to authenticate the user.

 * `Packet` objects are expected repeatedly until a `Packet` object with `op_code = 'q'` (quit)
 * is received. Each Packet is managed accordingly in this function. 
 *
 * Perhaps a better implementation would require extra modularity.
