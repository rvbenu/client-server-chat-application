Used getaddrinfo() to find a feasible address to establish a connection between cleint and server. 

`server.cpp` and `client.cpp` assume the messages sent will be short for now. 
TO-DO: When larger messages are sent, they must be broken down. This is to be implemented.

In `server.cpp`, connections are continuously being accepted by using an 
infinite loop. When a connection is accepted, a thread is crated. Function 
`manage_client_communication` manages client communication independently.
The thread is detached. 

Created files for the class UserAccount.  
TO-DO: The `hash_function` for passwords must be implemented.  

So far, the TCP connection with sockets is pretty much managed by the current code. 
Next, the validation of usernames and passwords must be implemented and the way 
the server and client will communicate about this must be implemented as well. 

Check comments in server.cpp and client.cpp for more details.

Decided to create a class `packet.h` that has many fields that won't necesarily be 
used for every communication between server and client. These packets are the only (main)
ones that will be serialized. 

The custom protocol is simple and uses / and spaces (goes from strings to binary) using encode. 
This is faster than the json protocol as the json protocol makes use of external libraries 
that most of the time add unnecessary detail for the simplicity of this application. 

According to a couple of practical tests while I was implementing the custom protocol, 
the custom protocol takes 0.8 the time it took for the json protocol to send packed data. 

For the json protocol implementation, made use of lnohlamn json library and MessagePack (a 
built in json-binary feature for this json library).

Modularized some components in client.cpp and server.cpp to improve the quality of utests. 
E.g., created connect to server function. Added unit tests.

Created server.h with documentation. 

IDEA: Improve modularity by creating functions to manage the different Packet objects (depending
on `op_code`) as opposed to having big chunks of code to handle these inside `handleClient`. 

IDEA: Create a Docker image to make it easier for users to use the application (avoiding 
adding lots of paths to libraries, e.g., openssl, argon2, lnohmann-json). 

Plan for tomorrow: Improve documentation for the wire protocol code (e.g., json_wire_procol.cpp, 
custom_wire_protocol.cpp, packet.cpp). If possible, do the same for the client code.

IDEA: Implement new fields in the `Packet` class such as `version`.
