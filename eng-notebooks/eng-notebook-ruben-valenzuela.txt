Used getaddrinfo() to find a feasible address to establish a connection between cleint and server. 

`server.cpp` and `client.cpp` assume the messages sent will be short for now. 
TO-DO: When larger messages are sent, they must be broken down. This is to be implemented.

In `server.cpp`, connections are continuously being accepted by using an 
infinite loop. When a connection is accepted, a thread is crated. Function 
`manage_client_communication` manages client communication independently.
The thread is detached. 

Created files for the class UserAccount.  
TO-DO: The `hash_function` for passwords must be implemented.  

So far, the TCP connection with sockets is pretty much managed by the current code. 
Next, the validation of usernames and passwords must be implemented and the way 
the server and client will communicate about this must be implemented as well. 

Check comments in server.cpp and client.cpp for more details.
