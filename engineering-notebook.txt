Just wrote some basic code for the cliet and the server. The idea is simple. From the client's perspective, 

When trying to compile client.cpp, there was no matching function for call to 'gethostbyname.' It turns out this funciton is obsolete. I used 'getaddrinfo' instead. 

The current code (commit: "") should be fine for sending simple messages (short messages). However, for larger ones, to ensure their full communication, one should use some sort of iteration.

Defined some data structures (e.g., messages). 

I used a naive hashing function. This needs to be changed later. 




Created UserAccount.cpp and .h class files.
